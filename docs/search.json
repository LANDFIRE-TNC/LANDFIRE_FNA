    "section": "Creating a Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel",
    "text": "Creating a Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel\n\nWhy Use Pivot Tables?\nWhen you combine rasters, the resulting table contains one row per unique combination of values from both rasters. This means that, in this example, the same EVT can be split into multiple rows, each associated with different BPS values. Consequently, you can‚Äôt simply sum the EVT acres directly from the table because the EVT acres are distributed across multiple rows.\nPivot tables allow us to summarize and aggregate data effectively. Here‚Äôs why we need to use pivot tables in this context:\n\nSummarizing EVT Acres\n\nSince EVT acres are split across multiple rows, we need to use a pivot table to aggregate the total acres for each EVT. This ensures we get an accurate representation of the total area covered by each vegetation type.\n\nCalculating Average Fire Return Interval (FRI)\n\nThe FRI values are tied to the underlying BpS pixels, meaning different pixels of the same EVT might have different FRI values. Using a pivot table allows us to calculate the average FRI for each EVT by summarizing the FRI values across all relevant rows.\n\nSummarizing FRI Acres\n\nTo understand the total number of acres that should burn annually based on historical fire return intervals, we need to summarize the FRI acres. Pivot tables help us aggregate these values to get a comprehensive view of fire needs for each EVT.\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step process\nüí° Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions for those who find them useful.\n\nInsert the pivot table\n\nSelect the range of cells that contains your data. Make sure to include the column headers.\nGo to the Insert tab on the Excel ribbon.\nClick on PivotTable in the Tables group.\nIn the Create PivotTable dialog box, ensure the selected range is correct.\nChoose to place the pivot table in a new worksheet or an existing worksheet. For this tutorial, select ‚ÄúNew Worksheet‚Äù and click OK.\n\nSet Up Your Pivot Table to summarize EVT data\n\nA new worksheet will open with a blank pivot table and the PivotTable Fields pane on the right.\nDrag and drop fields into the appropriate areas:\n\nRows: Drag the field you want to categorize your data by. In our case, we want to look at the EVT_NAME field.\nColumns: Drag the field you want to compare across categories. In our case, we want to look at the value fields we just set, which the pivot table will choose automatically.\nValues: Drag the fields you want to summarize. In our case, we want to look at FRI_ALLFIR, EVT Acres, and EVT Acres burned per year. By default, Excel will sum these values, but you can change the summary function by clicking on the field in the Values area and selecting ‚ÄúValue Field Settings‚Äù.\n\nYou will want to change the value fields for the FRI_ALLFIR field, as we want to look at the average FRI, not the summed FRI. To do this, click the drop-down arrow next to the field name, then choose Average from the Summarize value fields by options box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not a weighted average of the FRI, just a straight average. While this number will give you a good starting place, it‚Äôs best practice to use a weighted average ‚Äì taking into account how many acres of a given BPS were in the underlying EVT area ‚Äì to get a more representative fire return interval for the landscape. The process for creating the weighted average FRI using the pivot table is in the following section.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots for creating the pivot table\n\n\n\nSelect data and create a pivot table.\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nSelect the pivot table fields.\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nChange the FRI value field to average.\n\n\n¬†\nThis process will help you summarize your data, making it easier to understand and present your fire needs assessment results.",

    "section": "What is a Fire Needs Assessment?",
    "text": "What is a Fire Needs Assessment?\nA fire needs assessment (FNA) is a structured, science-based process used to evaluate where and to what extent fire is needed on a landscape to restore or maintain ecological integrity, reduce wildfire risk, and meet land management objectives. It integrates ecological principles, historical fire regimes, current vegetation conditions, and spatial data to identify areas where fire‚Äîeither through prescribed burning or managed wildfire‚Äîcan be applied beneficially. FNAs help land managers prioritize treatments by assessing the ecological need for fire, not just the risk of fire, which is a critical distinction in fire-adapted ecosystems.\nThe process typically involves spatial analysis using GIS to compare current vegetation and fire regime conditions against reference conditions (often derived from models like LANDFIRE or local ecological knowledge). This comparison highlights areas of departure‚Äîwhere fire has been excluded or altered‚Äîand helps quantify the type, amount, and frequency of fire needed to move the system toward desired conditions. FNAs are essential for aligning fire management with ecological goals, supporting NEPA planning, and justifying funding for prescribed fire programs. By grounding fire planning in ecological need, FNAs promote more strategic, effective, and defensible fire management decisions. Later in this website, we will showcase some examples of fire needs assessments and what programs have done with them.",

    "text": "The importance of fire needs assessments\nFire needs assessments are crucial for several reasons:\n\nThey elevate ecological need as a planning priority: FNAs shift the focus from fire risk to fire need, helping managers advocate for fire where it‚Äôs ecologically beneficial‚Äîeven in places where fire has long been absent.\nThey support landscape-scale restoration: FNAs help identify patterns of fire exclusion and suppression across large areas, guiding coordinated efforts to restore fire regimes that support biodiversity, resilience, and ecosystem health.\nThey strengthen the case for prescribed fire: By quantifying ecological need, FNAs provide a defensible rationale for prescribed fire programs ‚Äî supporting NEPA documentation, funding proposals, interagency planning, and more.\nThey foster collaboration and shared understanding: FNAs offer a common language and framework for land managers, scientists, and stakeholders to discuss fire needs, priorities, and trade-offs across jurisdictions.\nThey help tell the story of fire as a healing force: FNAs provide the data and context needed to communicate with the public about why fire is essential‚Äînot just dangerous‚Äîand how it can be used to restore landscapes and protect communities.\n\n\nPrescribed Fire as a Restoration Tool\nOne of the most important applications of a fire needs assessment is to effectively plan prescribed fire programs. Prescribed fire is not only a tool for maintaining landscapes but also for restoring them. Here‚Äôs how:\n\nEcosystem Restoration: Prescribed fire plays a pivotal role in restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems. It helps in the regeneration of native plant species, which in turn supports the wildlife that depends on these plants.\nWildlife Habitat Improvement: Numerous wildlife species depend on fire-maintained habitats for their survival. Prescribed fire helps create a mosaic of different habitat types, which is essential for biodiversity.\nInvasive Species Control: Fire is an effective tool for controlling invasive species that outcompete native plants. By reducing the presence of invasive species, prescribed fire helps restore the natural balance of ecosystems.\nReducing Fire Hazards: By reducing the accumulation of combustible materials, prescribed fire helps lower the risk of severe wildfires. This is particularly important in areas prone to wildfires.\nPromoting Forest Health: Fire helps in thinning dense forests, which reduces competition among trees and promotes the growth of healthier, more resilient forests.\nCarbon Management: Prescribed fire can help manage carbon levels in the soil and vegetation, contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem.",

Vegetation map units are primarily derived from NatureServe‚Äôs Ecological Systems classification, which is a nationally consistent set of mid-scale ecological units. Additional units are derived from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) Alliances, and LANDFIRE-specific types.\nEVTs are mapped using decision tree models, field data, Landsat imagery, elevation, and biophysical gradient data. Decision tree models are developed separately for each of the three lifeforms‚Äîtree, shrub, and herbaceous‚Äîand are then used to generate lifeform-specific EVT layers. The EVT layer is essential for understanding the current state of vegetation and planning management actions.",

The BPS concept asks ‚Äúwhere might an ecosystem occur‚Äù based on abiotic factors such as soils, surficial geology, slope and elevation as well as natural disturbance regimes.\nFor example, in many regions across the United States, the Biophysical Settings layer helps us understand the historical distribution of various ecosystems, such as grasslands, forests, and wetlands.

SyncroSim is designed to simulate and compare possible vegetation conditions across a landscape over time by considering the interaction between succession, disturbances, and management. LANDFIRE uses the SyncroSim package ST-Sim to estimate historical fire frequency and severity.\nSyncroSim and ST-Sim, have been supported by several agencies, including The Nature Conservancy, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and LANDFIRE. As a result, it is available as a free download.\nThe LANDFIRE Reference Condition table is a MS Excel file that provides LANDFIRE‚Äôs modeled estimate of historical fire frequency and severity for every BpS. This information is also in the attribute tables of the LANDFIRE Fire Return Interval and Percent Fire Severity spatial layers. This will directly plug into the process to help us understand historic and current fire on the landscape.\nYou can (and are encouraged to) re-define fire return intervals to better match what is on your landscape.

    "text": "Conducting a fire needs assessment involves understanding historical fire regimes and vegetation types to plan for future fire management and restoration efforts. This guide will walk you through the process, focusing on the LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BPS) and Fire Regime (FRI) data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis site will walk you through working with LANDFIRE spatial data in ArcGIS Pro. Some of this workflow may be possible in QGIS or other open source GIS sources, but those workflows are not documented here.\n\n\n\n\nüí° Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions for those who find them useful.\n\nIdentify historical vegetation types\n\nLoad LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings Data: Begin by loading the LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings spatial data into ArcGIS Pro\nClip to area of interest: Use the Clip Raster tool or the Extract by Mask tool (requires a Spatial Analyst license) to clip the BPS spatial data to your specific area of interest. This will help you focus on the relevant geographic region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to set the environment settings in the tool. Most importantly, make sure the spatial reference of your output raster is correct and set a snap raster (e.g.¬†the BPS_CONUS raster) to ensure your pixel extents match. This will be important later when you use one raster to process another.\n\n\n    -   **Identify vegetation types**: Examine the clipped BPS layer to identify the historical vegetation types present in your area.\n\nEstimate historical fire return intervals\n\nExplore fire return interval data: The BPS data include fire return interval (FRI) information. Display the raster on the FRI_ALLFIR field to explore the historical fire return intervals for the identified vegetation type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLANDFIRE also delivers the fire regime data separately. That dataset includes only fire severity, fire return interval, fire regime groups, and the BPS name and code. Use this if you prefer to work with a simplified version of the data. It will have all the information you need to complete this assessment.\n\n\n\nCalculate historical fire acreages\n\nAdd fields for calculation: Add an Acres field and an Acres_Year field to your clipped data.\nCalculate acres: Use the following formula to calculate the total acres for each vegetation type:\n\n\\[\nAcres=!COUNT!*900*0.000247105\n\\]\nHere, !COUNT! represents the number of pixels for each vegetation type, 900 is the area of each pixel in square meters, and 0.000247105 converts square meters to acres.\n\nCalculate acres burned annually: Use the following formula to calculate the number of acres that should burn each year for each BPS:\n\n\\[\nAcres\\_Year=!Acres!/!FRI\\_ALLFIR!\n\\]\nThis calculation will give you an estimate of the annual burned area under historical conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd BPS data to ArcGIS Pro.\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nCrop the BPS raster to your area of interest.\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nExplore BPS attributes on your landscape, including BPS names (shown in the vertical box), and fire regime information (shown in the horizontal box).\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nExamine the fire regime attributes by displaying the primary symbology on FRI_ALLFIR using Unique Values. (Note: the image shown here is using a custom color scheme. Your data may look different.)\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nAdd fields to the BpS raster. You can do this either by using the Add button in the attribute table or the Add Fields geoprocessing tool.\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nCalculate the acre field. You can do this by right clicking on the field name in the attribute table and selecting Calculate Field or with the Calculate Field geoprocessing tool. Repeat the process with the appropriate formula to calculate Acres Burned/Year.",
