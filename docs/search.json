    "section": "Creating a Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel",
    "text": "Creating a Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel\n\nWhy Use Pivot Tables?\nWhen you combine rasters, the resulting table contains one row per unique combination of values from both rasters. This means that, in this example, the same EVT can be split into multiple rows, each associated with different BPS values. Consequently, you can‚Äôt simply sum the EVT acres directly from the table because the EVT acres are distributed across multiple rows.\nPivot tables allow us to summarize and aggregate data effectively. Here‚Äôs why we need to use pivot tables in this context:\n\nSummarizing EVT Acres\n\nSince EVT acres are split across multiple rows, we need to use a pivot table to aggregate the total acres for each EVT. This ensures we get an accurate representation of the total area covered by each vegetation type.\n\nCalculating Average Fire Return Interval (FRI)\n\nThe FRI values are tied to the underlying BpS pixels, meaning different pixels of the same EVT might have different FRI values. Using a pivot table allows us to calculate the average FRI for each EVT by summarizing the FRI values across all relevant rows.\n\nSummarizing FRI Acres\n\nTo understand the total number of acres that should burn annually based on historical fire return intervals, we need to summarize the FRI acres. Pivot tables help us aggregate these values to get a comprehensive view of fire needs for each EVT.\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step process\nüí° Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions for those who find them useful.\n\nInsert the pivot table\n\nSelect the range of cells that contains your data. Make sure to include the column headers.\nGo to the Insert tab on the Excel ribbon.\nClick on PivotTable in the Tables group.\nIn the Create PivotTable dialog box, ensure the selected range is correct.\nChoose to place the pivot table in a new worksheet or an existing worksheet. For this tutorial, select ‚ÄúNew Worksheet‚Äù and click OK.\n\nSet Up Your Pivot Table to summarize EVT data\n\nA new worksheet will open with a blank pivot table and the PivotTable Fields pane on the right.\nDrag and drop fields into the appropriate areas:\n\nRows: Drag the field you want to categorize your data by. In our case, we want to look at the EVT_NAME field.\nColumns: Drag the field you want to compare across categories. In our case, we want to look at the value fields we just set, which the pivot table will choose automatically.\nValues: Drag the fields you want to summarize. In our case, we want to look at FRI_ALLFIR, EVT Acres, and EVT Acres burned per year. By default, Excel will sum these values, but you can change the summary function by clicking on the field in the Values area and selecting ‚ÄúValue Field Settings‚Äù.\n\nYou will want to change the value fields for the FRI_ALLFIR field, as we want to look at the average FRI, not the summed FRI. To do this, click the drop-down arrow next to the field name, then choose Average from the Summarize value fields by options box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not a weighted average of the FRI, just a straight average. While this number will give you a good starting place, it‚Äôs best practice to use a weighted average ‚Äì taking into account how many acres of a given BPS were in the underlying EVT area ‚Äì to get a more representative fire return interval for the landscape. The process for creating the weighted average FRI using the pivot table is in the following section.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots for creating the pivot table\n\n\n\nSelect data and create a pivot table.\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nSelect the pivot table fields.\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nChange the FRI value field to average.\n\n\n¬†\nThis process will help you summarize your data, making it easier to understand and present your fire needs assessment results.",

    "section": "What is a Fire Needs Assessment?",
    "text": "What is a Fire Needs Assessment?\nA fire needs assessment (FNA) is a structured, science-based process used to evaluate where and to what extent fire is needed on a landscape to restore or maintain ecological integrity, reduce wildfire risk, and meet land management objectives. It integrates ecological principles, historical fire regimes, current vegetation conditions, and spatial data to identify areas where fire‚Äîeither through prescribed burning or managed wildfire‚Äîcan be applied beneficially. FNAs help land managers prioritize treatments by assessing the ecological need for fire, not just the risk of fire, which is a critical distinction in fire-adapted ecosystems.\nThe process typically involves spatial analysis using GIS to compare current vegetation and fire regime conditions against reference conditions (often derived from models like LANDFIRE or local ecological knowledge). This comparison highlights areas of departure‚Äîwhere fire has been excluded or altered‚Äîand helps quantify the type, amount, and frequency of fire needed to move the system toward desired conditions. FNAs are essential for aligning fire management with ecological goals, supporting NEPA planning, and justifying funding for prescribed fire programs. By grounding fire planning in ecological need, FNAs promote more strategic, effective, and defensible fire management decisions. Later in this website, we will showcase some examples of fire needs assessments and what programs have done with them.",

    "section": "The importance of fire needs assessments",
    "text": "The importance of fire needs assessments\nFire needs assessments are crucial for several reasons:\n\nThey elevate ecological need as a planning priority: FNAs shift the focus from fire risk to fire need, helping managers advocate for fire where it‚Äôs ecologically beneficial‚Äîeven in places where fire has long been absent.\nThey support landscape-scale restoration: FNAs help identify patterns of fire exclusion and suppression across large areas, guiding coordinated efforts to restore fire regimes that support biodiversity, resilience, and ecosystem health.\nThey strengthen the case for prescribed fire: By quantifying ecological need, FNAs provide a defensible rationale for prescribed fire programs ‚Äî supporting NEPA documentation, funding proposals, interagency planning, and more.\nThey foster collaboration and shared understanding: FNAs offer a common language and framework for land managers, scientists, and stakeholders to discuss fire needs, priorities, and trade-offs across jurisdictions.\nThey help tell the story of fire as a healing force: FNAs provide the data and context needed to communicate with the public about why fire is essential‚Äînot just dangerous‚Äîand how it can be used to restore landscapes and protect communities.\n\n\nPrescribed Fire as a Restoration Tool\nOne of the most important applications of a fire needs assessment is to effectively plan prescribed fire programs. Prescribed fire is not only a tool for maintaining landscapes but also for restoring them. Here‚Äôs how:\n\nEcosystem Restoration: Prescribed fire plays a pivotal role in restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems. It helps in the regeneration of native plant species, which in turn supports the wildlife that depends on these plants.\nWildlife Habitat Improvement: Numerous wildlife species depend on fire-maintained habitats for their survival. Prescribed fire helps create a mosaic of different habitat types, which is essential for biodiversity.\nInvasive Species Control: Fire is an effective tool for controlling invasive species that outcompete native plants. By reducing the presence of invasive species, prescribed fire helps restore the natural balance of ecosystems.\nReducing Fire Hazards: By reducing the accumulation of combustible materials, prescribed fire helps lower the risk of severe wildfires. This is particularly important in areas prone to wildfires.\nPromoting Forest Health: Fire helps in thinning dense forests, which reduces competition among trees and promotes the growth of healthier, more resilient forests.\nCarbon Management: Prescribed fire can help manage carbon levels in the soil and vegetation, contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem.",

Historical fire data can guide the use of prescribed burns to maintain biodiversity and prevent the spread of invasive species.\nSoutheast US: The Southeast has a long history of fire-adapted ecosystems. Fire needs assessments are crucial for maintaining the health of pine forests and grasslands. Understanding fire return intervals helps in planning prescribed burns to mimic natural fire cycles.\nCentral US: In the Central US, fire needs assessments are used to manage prairies and savannas.

This information provides a baseline for understanding current conditions and planning restoration efforts.\nBiophysical Settings (BPS) are a foundational concept for LANDFIRE defined on the LANDFIRE Program website as:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶a modeled representation of the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of modeled past disturbance regimes.‚Äù\n\nWe like to think of the Biophysical Settings as ‚Äòecosystem habitats‚Äô, or ‚Äòpotential ecosystem footprints‚Äô. The BPS concept asks ‚Äúwhere might an ecosystem occur‚Äù based on abiotic factors such as soils, surficial geology, slope and elevation as well as natural disturbance regimes.\nFor example, in many regions across the United States, the Biophysical Settings layer helps us understand the historical distribution of various ecosystems, such as grasslands, forests, and wetlands.

SyncroSim is designed to simulate and compare possible vegetation conditions across a landscape over time by considering the interaction between succession, disturbances, and management. LANDFIRE uses the SyncroSim package ST-Sim to estimate historical fire frequency and severity.\nSyncroSim and ST-Sim, have been supported by several agencies, including The Nature Conservancy, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and LANDFIRE. As a result, it is available as a free download.\nThe LANDFIRE Reference Condition table is a MS Excel file that provides LANDFIRE‚Äôs modeled estimate of historical fire frequency and severity for every BpS.

    "text": "There are many ways to refine your fire needs assessment once you start understanding fire regimes on your landscape. We encourage you to explore other fire needs assessments and think about ways you can apply these approaches on your landscape. The following web app highlights fire needs assessments from around the US. Click on each state to get a pop up with details such as the area, title, year, author, and links to the assessments.\n\n&lt;section id=\"a-few-highlighted-approaches\" class=\"level3\"&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A few highlighted approaches&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illinois Fire Needs Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;: Illinois took the process outlined here and built on it by crosswalking EVT and BpS to better understand Fire Return Intervals (FRI) in the EVT systems, rather than just using the underlying BpS. They also conducted a survey of experts to understand current fire return intervals. This approach provided a more nuanced understanding of fire needs in their landscape. &lt;a href=\"https://www.illinoisprescribedfirecouncil.org/uploads/1/0/5/8/105892833/il_fire_needs_assessment.pdf\"&gt;Read more about their assessment&lt;/a&gt; (opens a pdf).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michigan Fire Needs Assessments&lt;/strong&gt;: Michigan used GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis to assess the ecological need for prescribed fire. This method allowed them to integrate various factors and make informed decisions about fire management. They also developed a prescribed fire model to visualize and plan fire needs. &lt;a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/02094dd68d874331a9977fc80d6d7247\"&gt;View their story map&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/13/3/100\"&gt;read their published paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minnesota Fire Needs Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;: Minnesota crosswalked EVT with local vegetation classifications and summarized by county and by agency to better understand fire needs in their local landscapes. This approach helped them tailor their fire management practices to the specific needs of their region. &lt;a href=\"https://www.mnprescribedfire.org/mnfireneedsassessment\"&gt;Explore their assessment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisconsin Fire Needs Assessments&lt;/strong&gt;: Wisconsin took a more methodological approach to assess fire needs.

Click on each state to get a pop up with details such as the area, title, year, author, and links to the assessments.\n\n&lt;section id=\"a-few-highlighted-approaches\" class=\"level3\"&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A few highlighted approaches&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illinois Fire Needs Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;: Illinois took the process outlined here and built on it by crosswalking EVT and BpS to better understand Fire Return Intervals (FRI) in the EVT systems, rather than just using the underlying BpS. They also conducted a survey of experts to understand current fire return intervals. This approach provided a more nuanced understanding of fire needs in their landscape. &lt;a href=\"https://www.illinoisprescribedfirecouncil.org/uploads/1/0/5/8/105892833/il_fire_needs_assessment.pdf\"&gt;Read more about their assessment&lt;/a&gt; (opens a pdf).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michigan Fire Needs Assessments&lt;/strong&gt;: Michigan used GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis to assess the ecological need for prescribed fire. This method allowed them to integrate various factors and make informed decisions about fire management. They also developed a prescribed fire model to visualize and plan fire needs. &lt;a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/02094dd68d874331a9977fc80d6d7247\"&gt;View their story map&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/13/3/100\"&gt;read their published paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minnesota Fire Needs Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;: Minnesota crosswalked EVT with local vegetation classifications and summarized by county and by agency to better understand fire needs in their local landscapes. This approach helped them tailor their fire management practices to the specific needs of their region. &lt;a href=\"https://www.mnprescribedfire.org/mnfireneedsassessment\"&gt;Explore their assessment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisconsin Fire Needs Assessments&lt;/strong&gt;: Wisconsin took a more methodological approach to assess fire needs. Their detailed analysis provided insights into fire management practices and helped them develop effective strategies. &lt;a href=\"http://lakestatesfiresci.net/docs/LSFSC_Oct82014_Assessing%20Needs%20Hmielowski_TPOS_LS%20FINAL.pdf\"&gt;Learn more about their initial assessment&lt;/a&gt; (opens a pdf) and &lt;a href=\"https://staceymarion.com/fna/\"&gt;explore the more recent update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;section id=\"exploring-other-approaches\" class=\"level3\"&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Exploring other approaches&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are many other approaches to fire needs assessments, including using LANDFIRE BpS models and ST-Sim to explore changing fire regimes and disturbance pathways and their effects on the landscape.
