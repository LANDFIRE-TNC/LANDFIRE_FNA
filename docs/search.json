    "section": "What is a Fire Needs Assessment?",
    "text": "What is a Fire Needs Assessment?\nA fire needs sssessment (FNA) is a structured, science-based process used to evaluate where and to what extent fire is needed on a landscape to restore or maintain ecological integrity, reduce wildfire risk, and meet land management objectives. It integrates ecological principles, historical fire regimes, current vegetation conditions, and spatial data to identify areas where fire—either through prescribed burning or managed wildfire—can be applied beneficially. FNAs help land managers prioritize treatments by assessing the ecological need for fire, not just the risk of fire, which is a critical distinction in fire-adapted ecosystems.\nThe process typically involves spatial analysis using GIS to compare current vegetation and fire regime conditions against reference conditions (often derived from models like LANDFIRE or local ecological knowledge). This comparison highlights areas of departure—where fire has been excluded or altered—and helps quantify the type, amount, and frequency of fire needed to move the system toward desired conditions. FNAs are essential for aligning fire management with ecological goals, supporting NEPA planning, and justifying funding for prescribed fire programs. By grounding fire planning in ecological need, FNAs promote more strategic, effective, and defensible fire management decisions. Later in this website, we will showcase some examples of fire needs assessments and what programs have done with them.",

    "text": "The importance of fire needs assessments\nFire needs assessments are crucial for several reasons:\n\nThey elevate ecological need as a planning priority: FNAs shift the focus from fire risk to fire need, helping managers advocate for fire where it’s ecologically beneficial—even in places where fire has long been absent.\nThey support landscape-scale restoration: FNAs help identify patterns of fire exclusion and suppression across large areas, guiding coordinated efforts to restore fire regimes that support biodiversity, resilience, and ecosystem health.\nThey strengthen the case for prescribed fire: By quantifying ecological need, FNAs provide a defensible rationale for prescribed fire programs — supporting NEPA documentation, funding proposals, interagency planning, and more.\nThey foster collaboration and shared understanding: FNAs offer a common language and framework for land managers, scientists, and stakeholders to discuss fire needs, priorities, and trade-offs across jurisdictions.\nThey help tell the story of fire as a healing force: FNAs provide the data and context needed to communicate with the public about why fire is essential—not just dangerous—and how it can be used to restore landscapes and protect communities.\n\n\nPrescribed Fire as a Restoration Tool\nOne of the most important applications of a fire needs assessment is to effectively plan prescribed fire programs. Prescribed fire is not only a tool for maintaining landscapes but also for restoring them. Here’s how:\n\nEcosystem Restoration: Prescribed fire plays a pivotal role in restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems. It helps in the regeneration of native plant species, which in turn supports the wildlife that depends on these plants.\nWildlife Habitat Improvement: Numerous wildlife species depend on fire-maintained habitats for their survival. Prescribed fire helps create a mosaic of different habitat types, which is essential for biodiversity.\nInvasive Species Control: Fire is an effective tool for controlling invasive species that outcompete native plants. By reducing the presence of invasive species, prescribed fire helps restore the natural balance of ecosystems.\nReducing Fire Hazards: By reducing the accumulation of combustible materials, prescribed fire helps lower the risk of severe wildfires. This is particularly important in areas prone to wildfires.\nPromoting Forest Health: Fire helps in thinning dense forests, which reduces competition among trees and promotes the growth of healthier, more resilient forests.\nCarbon Management: Prescribed fire can help manage carbon levels in the soil and vegetation, contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem.",

Historical fire data can guide the use of prescribed burns to maintain biodiversity and prevent the spread of invasive species.\nSoutheast US: The Southeast has a long history of fire-adapted ecosystems. Fire needs assessments are crucial for maintaining the health of pine forests and grasslands. Understanding fire return intervals helps in planning prescribed burns to mimic natural fire cycles.\nCentral US: In the Central US, fire needs assessments are used to manage prairies and savannas.

This information provides a baseline for understanding current conditions and planning restoration efforts.\nBiophysical Settings (BPS) are a foundational concept for LANDFIRE defined on the LANDFIRE Program website as:\n\n“…a modeled representation of the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of modeled past disturbance regimes.”\n\nWe like to think of the Biophysical Settings as ‘ecosystem habitats’, or ‘potential ecosystem footprints’. The BPS concept asks “where might an ecosystem occur” based on abiotic factors such as soils, surficial geology, slope and elevation as well as natural disturbance regimes.\nFor example, in many regions across the United States, the Biophysical Settings layer helps us understand the historical distribution of various ecosystems, such as grasslands, forests, and wetlands.

It allows users to develop and run aspatial or spatially-explicit, stochastic state-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) of vegetation change. SyncroSim is designed to simulate and compare possible vegetation conditions across a landscape over time by considering the interaction between succession, disturbances, and management. LANDFIRE uses the SyncroSim package ST-Sim to estimate historical fire frequency and severity.\nSyncroSim and ST-Sim, have been supported by several agencies, including The Nature Conservancy, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and LANDFIRE. As a result, it is available as a free download.\nThe LANDFIRE Reference Condition table is a MS Excel file that provides LANDFIRE’s modeled estimate of historical fire frequency and severity for every BpS. This information is also in the attribute tables of the LANDFIRE Fire Return Interval and Percent Fire Severity spatial layers. This will directly plug into the process to help us understand historic and current fire on the landscape.\nYou can (and are encouraged to) re-define fire return intervals to better match what is on your landscape.
