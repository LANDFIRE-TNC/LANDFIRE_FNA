## How can LANDFIRE help?

One of the significant challenges in many assessments is the lack of basic data due to limited time and resources. LANDFIRE addresses this issue by providing a set of comprehensive, cross-boundary, consistent vegetation, fuels, and fire information data. Additionally, LANDFIRE has implemented a long-term Operations and Maintenance Plan to keep this data up to date. While LANDFIRE was initially developed for national, regional, and very large landscape analyses, its products are also relevant for smaller geographies after local review. This flexibility makes LANDFIRE a valuable tool for various scales of landscape management.

### The LANDFIRE Product Suite

LANDFIRE offers a large suite of products developed for a wide range of disciplines, including vegetation, fuels, fire regime, and disturbance. These products are essential for various landscape management and planning activities.

The layers we are predominantly concerned with for these fire needs assessments are:

- [**Biophysical Settings**](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps)
- [**Existing Vegetation Type**](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/evt)
- [**Mean Fire Return Interval**](https://landfire.gov/fire-regime/fri)
- [**Fire Regime Groups**](https://landfire.gov/fire-regime/frg)

You may also find some of the fuels datasets helpful in your assessments or your work with fire.
