## Creating a Summary Table in Microsoft Excel

Once you have summarized EVT Acres, EVT acres burned per year, and the
weighted average FRI for each EVT using a pivot table, you can create a
new table in a new worksheet tab to organize this data. This will help
you clearly see, for each EVT name, the average historical FRI, the
total acres of each EVT on the landscape, and the acres of that EVT
burned each year.

### Step-by-Step Process

*Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions
for those who find them useful.*

1.  **Summarize Data in Pivot Table**

    -   Ensure your pivot table summarizes the following:
        -   **EVT Acres**: Total acres for each EVT.

        -   **EVT Acres Burned per Year**: Total acres burned annually
            for each EVT.

        -   **Average FRI**: Average historical fire return interval for
            each EVT.

2.  **Copy Pivot Table Data**

    -   Select the entire pivot table.

    -   Right-click and choose "Copy" or press `Ctrl+C`.

3.  **Create a New Worksheet Tab**

    -   Click the "+" icon at the bottom of the Excel window to create a
        new worksheet tab.

4.  **Paste Pivot Table Data**

    -   In the new worksheet tab, right-click in the first cell (A1) and
        choose "Paste Special".

    -   Select "Values" from the Paste Special options and click "OK".
        This ensures you are pasting only the values, not the pivot
        table formatting.

5.  **Clean Up Table Headers**

    -   Review the pasted data and update the table headers to something
        more meaningful. For example:
        -   **EVT Name**

        -   **Average Historical FRI**

        -   **Total EVT Acres**

        -   **EVT Acres Burned per Year**

6.  **Format the Table**

    -   Adjust column widths and apply any necessary formatting to
        improve readability.

    -   You can also add filters to the headers to make it easier to
        sort and analyze the data.

This process will help you create a clear and organized summary table,
making it easier to understand and present your fire needs assessment
results.

**Bonus action**: You can also calculate what percent of each EVT should
burn per year, by adding a column and then using a formula to divide EVT
acres burned per year by total EVT acres.

## Saving the worksheet back to a .csv file

Once you have created your summary table, you will likely want to save
it back to a CSV file to ensure compatibility with various programs,
including ArcGIS Pro.

CSV files have very particular formatting needs. You will not be able to
save the pivot table to the .csv format, only the content in the summary
table worksheet. There is no way to save just one worksheet, so you will
first need to copy the summary table to a new Excel workbook and save
the .csv file from there.

### Step-by-step process

1.  Click on File in the Excel ribbon.

2.  Select Save As.

3.  Choose the location to save the file.

4.  In the Save As type dropdown menu, select CSV (comma delimited)
    (\*.csv).

5.  Enter a meaningful name for the file and click Save.
