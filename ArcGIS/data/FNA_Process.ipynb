    "The combined raster currently contains only basic fields (e.g., Object ID, Value, Count, and the value fields from BPS and EVT). To make this data useful for analysis, we need to join additional attributes from the original BPS and EVT rasters and then export the table for further processing. This table will serve as the foundation for calculating fire return metrics and summarizing results by vegetation type.\n",

    "  - Fields include: `BPS_NAME`, `BPS_MODEL`, `GROUPVEG`, fire return interval fields (`FRI_ALLFIR`, `FRI_REPLAC`, `FRI_MIXED`, `FRI_SURFAC`), fire severity percentages, and acreage fields (`Acres`, `Acres_Year`).\n",
